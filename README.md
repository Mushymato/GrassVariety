# GrassVariety

An alternative to [More Grass](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/5398) with better support for blue grass.

## Usage

There is 1 config for players and it can be set via console command `gv-default_grass_weight [weight]`.

This changes how frequently the vanilla grass texture (which could have been changed by mods through content patcher EditImage) appear.
