New grass framework.

## For Authors

See [author-guilde.md](docs/author-guide.md).

## For Players

### Installation

1. Install SMAPI and Content Patcher
2. Install this mod by extracting it and placing it in your `Mods` folder.

### Config

The `DefaultGrassWeight` config changes how frequently the vanilla grass texture (`TerrainFeatures/grass`) appear. The default is 0, but you may use this to allow some compatibility between this mod direct and content patcher grass retextures.

At the moment it can be set via console command `gv-default_grass_weight [weight]` or by editing `config.json`, no GMCM support for now.

## Compatiblity

This mod is not compatible with [More Grass](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/5398) which patches draw directly and takes effect over this mod completely. There are no plans to introduce compatibility due to feature overlap and this mod functions very differently than More Grass.
